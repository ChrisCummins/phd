"""Construct ProGraML graph representation from LLVM IR.

This program reads an LLVM bitcode file from stdin and prints the program graph
protobuf representation to stdout.

Example Usage
=============

Generate a C source file that can be used to derive an intermediate
representation file:

    $ echo "int main() { return 5; }" > /tmp/foo.c

Create an LLVM intermediate representation:

    $ bazel run //compilers/llvm:clang -- -- \\
        /tmp/foo.c -emit-llvm -S -o /tmp/foo.ll

Generate a program graph proto from this IR:

    $ bazel run //deeplearning/ml4pl/graphs/unlabelled/llvm2graph -- \\
        < /tmp/foo.ll
"""

from deeplearning.ml4pl.graphs import programl
from deeplearning.ml4pl.graphs.unlabelled.llvm2graph import graph_builder
from labm8.py import app

FLAGS = app.FLAGS

app.DEFINE_string(
  "opt",
  None,
  "The path of the LLVM opt binary to use. If not provided, the default "
  "project binary will be used.",
)


def Main():
  """Main entry point."""
  bytecode = sys.stdin.read()
  builder = graph_builder.ProGraMLGraphBuilder()
  g = builder.Build(bytecode, FLAGS.opt)
  print(programl.NetworkXToProgramGraph(g))


if __name__ == "__main__":
  app.Run(Main)
