"""CLgen: a deep learning program generator.

The core operations of CLgen are:

  1. Preprocess and encode a corpus of handwritten example programs.
  2. Define and train a machine learning model on the corpus.
  3. Sample the trained model to generate new programs.

This program automates the execution of all three stages of the pipeline.
The pipeline can be interrupted and resumed at any time. Results are cached
across runs. Please note that many of the steps in the pipeline are extremely
compute intensive and highly parallelized. If configured with CUDA support,
any NVIDIA GPUs will be used to improve performance where possible.
