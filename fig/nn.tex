    DeepTune artificial neural networks, configured for (a) heterogeneous mapping, and (b) thread coarsening factor. The design stays almost the same regardless of the optimisation problem. The only changes are the extra input for (a) and size of the output layers. To aid in visualisation, the number of neurons in each layer is reduced. For the true neuron counts, see Table~\ref{tab:nn-size}%
