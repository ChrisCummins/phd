# Timing.app

[Timing](https://timingapp.com/) is a macOS app for passive time tracking by
monitoring the time spent in different applications, and group applications
based on the type of activity.

## Exported Data

Aggregating Timing.app data can be performed automatically by reading the
application's database, located at
`~/Library/Application Support/info.eurocomp.Timing2/SQLite.db`. The schema
is pretty straightforward, with the `AppActivity`, `Task`, and `Applidation`
tables providing the data we're interested in exporting.

This query joins the tables in a format which closely resembles the Measurements
that are extracted:

```
SELECT
  Task.title as series,
  CAST(ROUND(AppActivity.startDate * 1000.0) AS int) as date,
  CAST(ROUND((AppActivity.endDate - AppActivity.startDate) * 1000.0) AS int) as value,
  Application.title as `group`
FROM
  AppActivity
LEFT JOIN
  Application
  ON AppActivity.applicationID=AppActivity.id
LEFT JOIN
  Task ON AppActivity.taskID=Task.id;
```


## Imported Data

The `SeriesCollection` proto generated by my `_ReadDatabaseToSeriesCollection()`
function contains one series for each `Task.title`. The following schema is
used:

```
Series.name                      ${Task.title}
Series.family                    "ScreenTime"
Series.unit                      "milliseconds"
Measurement.group                ${Application.title}
Measurement.ms_since_unix_epoch  ${AppActivity.startDate} in milliseconds (see below).
Measurement.value                (end - start) in milliseconds (see below).
Measurement.source               "Timing.app"
```
