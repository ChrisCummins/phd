// Protocol buffers for aggregating personal data from various sources.
//
// This project is a data processing pipeline which aggregates data from third
// party sources to a shared database. Protocol buffers are used as the
// intermediate representation - data is aggregated from third party sources
// to protocol buffers, then uniform logic handles the conversion from protobuf
// to the database.
//
// Since protocol buffers are only used as an intermediate representation before
// data is imported into a database, the protobufs defined in this file are not
// designed to be used for long term storage of data. The schema may change at
// any time, and most fields are marked as required.
//
// The data hiearchy used by the project groups measurements into series, and
// series into families:
//
//                  Family
//                  /   \
//               Series  ...
//                /  \
//             Group  ...
//               |
//         [Measurement ...]
//
