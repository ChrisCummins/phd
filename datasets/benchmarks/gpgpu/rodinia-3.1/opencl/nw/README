Note: This program generate two sequences randomly. Please specify your own sequences for different uses.
      At the current stage, the program only supports two sequences with the same lengh, which can be divided by 16. 
Usage: ./nw 2048 10 ./nw.cl
	  2048 //the length of the sequence
	  10 //penalty value
	  ./nw.cl  //ocl kernel file

******Adjustable work group size*****
RD_WG_SIZE_0 or RD_WG_SIZE_0_0 

USAGE:
make clean
make KERNEL_DIM="-DRD_WG_SIZE_0=16"
