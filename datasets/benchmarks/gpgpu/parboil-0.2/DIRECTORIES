    tools/
        Benchmark-specific utilities
      compare-output
          Tool to verify that the output of a benchmark is correct

datasets/
    Benchmark datasets.
    Each benchmark has its own directory.  Different datasets may be found in 
    different subdirectories.  

  benchmarkname/
    datasetname/
        Directory for a single dataset
      input/
          Benchmark input files for this dataset. 
        DESCRIPTION
            Optional description of the data set.  See README.benchmarks for 
            using this file to control the passing of command-line parameters 
            to the benchmark executable.

      output/
          Reference output for this dataset.  The driver only supports a 
          single file in this directory, which is compared with generated 
          benchmark output to validate it.

parboil
    The driver program for inspecting, compiling, and running benchmarks.
