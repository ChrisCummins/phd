       The non-multi-threaded version of the contention benchmark

This splits the process space into processes that do MPI communication and
processes that do GPU communication. The processes that do GPU communication
are equal to then number of devices on the node.

Node Random Pairs: Forms pairs of nodes first, then pairs processes within the
nodes. For example, if node 0 and 1 have 4 processes each, and 0 and 1 are
paired, then process 0 on node 0 is paired with process 0 on node 1 which is
MPI rank 4 (when nodes are not allocated in a round robin or any other weird
way). Similarly, process 1 on node 0 is paired with process 1 on node 1 which
is MPI rank 5.
