The data directory is meant to serve as a resource for SHOC runs using the
shocdriver on different devices and platforms. Results can be contributed
either by emailing a SHOC development member, issuing a pull request, or
committing an update (for those with write access). If you would like to 
report a result for a device that is not listed, please provide the 
following:

devices.csv: 
-----------
For a particular discrete accelerator, it is helpful to have the host system
information to make comparisons between different devices and replicate 
tests. New results should include not just the device name and vendor 
but also the host platform used for testing. 

On a Linux system the CPU, memory size and speed, and motherboard can be 
found using dmidecode or lshw. In certain cases dmesg can also be used to
find the specific motherboard model number. For OS, the Linux kernel version 
from uname is preferred or the common name (OSX 10.6) can suffice for other
OSes.

specs.csv:
-----------
For a particular accelerator, the key specifications for the device are
reported. PCIe Gen (2.0, 3.0, etc.) and introduction date (or first sale date)
are new fields that have been added.

For devices with a boost clock (e.g. NVIDIA Maxwell), report the
boost clock instead of the base clock. (This boost clock is the
average clock speed at which the device actually runs, not
the absolute maximum clockspeed the device supports, and so should
most closely represent the card's real-life performance.)

platforms.csv:
--------------
Here the software platforms for a particular set of experiments are added. 

results.csv:
------------
Results from a SHOC run using shocdriver are added to the results CSV and
are correlated with the device and platform. New fields include the test
size (4 is recommended) and the test date which should be the date when 
the test was last run for the listed results.
