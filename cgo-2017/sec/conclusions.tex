\section{Conclusion}%
\label{sec:conclusion}

The quality of predictive models is bound by the quantity and quality of programs used for training, yet there is typically only a few dozen common benchmarks available for experiments. We present a novel tool which is the first of it's kind --- an entirely probabilistic program generator capable of generating an unbounded number of human like programs. Our approach applies deep learning over a huge corpus of publicly available code from GitHub to automatically infer the semantics and practical usage of a programming language. Our tool generates programs which to trained eyes are indistinguishable from hand-written code. We tested our approach using a state of the art predictive model, improving its performance by a factor of $1.27\times$. We found that synthetic benchmarks exposed weaknesses in the feature set which, when corrected, further improved the performance by $4.30\times$. Our hope for this work is to demonstrate a proof of concept for an exciting new avenue of program generation, and that the full release of CLgen will expedite discovery in other domains. In future work we will extend the approach to multiple programming languages, and investigate methods for performing an automatic directed search of feature spaces.
