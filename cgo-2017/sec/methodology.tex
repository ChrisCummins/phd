\subsection{Experimental Setup}\label{subsec:experimental-setup}

\paragraph{Predictive Model} We reproduce the predictive model from \citeauthor{Grewe2013}~\cite{Grewe2013}. The predictive model is used to determine the optimal mapping of a given OpenCL kernel to either a GPU or CPU. It uses supervised learning to construct a decision tree with a combination of static and dynamic kernel features extracted from source code and the OpenCL runtime, detailed in Table~\ref{tab:features-cgo13}.

\paragraph{Benchmarks} As in~\cite{Grewe2013}, we test our model on the NAS Parallel Benchmarks (NPB)~\cite{Bailey1991a}. We use the hand-optimized OpenCL implementation of \citeauthor{Seo2011}~\cite{Seo2011}. In~\cite{Grewe2013} the authors augment the training set of the predictive model with 47 additional kernels taken from 4 GPGPU benchmark suites.  To more fully sample the program space, we use a much larger collection of 142 programs, summarized in Table~\ref{tab:benchmarks}. These additional programs are taken from all 7 of the most frequently used benchmark suites identified in Section~\ref{subsec:motivation}. None of these programs were used to train CLgen. We synthesized 1,000 kernels with CLgen to use as additional benchmarks.

\paragraph{Platforms} We evaluate our approach on two 64-bit CPU-GPU systems, detailed in Table~\ref{tab:platforms}. One system has an AMD GPU and uses OpenSUSE 12.3; the other is equipped with an NVIDIA GPU and uses Ubuntu 16.04. Both platforms were unloaded.

  \end{tabular}

\end{table}

\paragraph{Datasets} The NPB and Parboil benchmark suites are packaged with multiple datasets. We use all of the packaged datasets (5 per program in NPB, 1-4 per program in Parboil). For all other benchmarks, the default datasets are used. We configured the CLgen host driver to synthesize payloads between 128B-130MB, approximating that of the dataset sizes found in the benchmark programs.

\subsection{Methodology}

We replicated the methodology of~\cite{Grewe2013}. Each experiment is repeated five times and the average execution time is recorded. The execution time includes both device compute time and the data transfer overheads.

We use \emph{leave-one-out cross-validation} to evaluate predictive models. For each benchmark, a model is trained on data from all other benchmarks and used to predict the mapping for each kernel and dataset in the excluded program. We repeat this process with and without the addition of synthetic benchmarks in the training data. We do not test model predictions on synthetic benchmarks.
