We thank the reviewers for their time in evaluating and providing feedback on our artifact.

# Review 1

1.1. Thanks for the positive feedback. For customization, all our code and data is on GitHub, see: https://github.com/ChrisCummins/clgen
We have already merged a first contribution from a third party.


# Review 2

2.1. We did not provide the code to produce new data for Figure 9, sorry. The results as they appear in the paper are replicated in 'Paper.ipynb'.

2.2. See Review 1.1. regarding customization.


# Review 3

3.1. You are correct; we selected a small subset of the test cases to reproduce Figures 7 and 8. This is so that evaluation takes minutes, rather than weeks (as in the paper) - while providing results consistent with those in the paper. However, we will make our documentation for reproducing on a larger subset of data more clear as per your suggestions. Concretely:

3.2. To generate more synthetic kernels, modify attribute "max_kernels" in our CLgen demonstration. We will clarify this on GitHub and the AE instructions.

3.3 To generate data for more benchmarks, download a benchmark suite (e.g. Rodinia) and instrument using libcecl. We cannot package all of the benchmark suites on GitHub due to their size (several gigabytes for the full set), but we will add detailed instructions on GitHub.
