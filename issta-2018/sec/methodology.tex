\section{Experimental Setup}

In this section we describe the experimental parameters used.

\subsection{OpenCL Systems}

We conducted testing of 10 OpenCL systems, summarized in
Table~\ref{tab:platforms}. We covered a broad range of hardware: 3 GPUs, 4
CPUs, a co-processor, and an emulator. 7 of the compilers tested are commercial
products, 3 of them are open source. Our suite of systems includes both
combinations of different drivers for the same device, and different devices
using the same driver.

\subsection{Testbeds}

For each OpenCL system, we create two testbeds. In the first, the compiler is
run with optimizations disabled. In the second, optimizations are enabled. Each
testbed is then a triple, consisting of \emph{<device, driver, is\_optimized>}
settings. This mechanism gives 20 testbeds to evaluate.


\subsection{Test Cases}

For each generated program we create inputs as described in
Section~\ref{sec:test-harness}. In addition, we need to choose the number of
threads to use. We generate two test cases, one using one thread, the other
using 2048 threads. A test case is then a triple, consisting of \emph{<program,
inputs, threads>} settings.

\subsection{Bug Search Time Allowance}

We compare both our fuzzer and CLSmith. We allow both to run for 48 hours on
each of the 20 testbeds. CLSmith used its default configuration. The total
runtime for a test case consists of the generation and execution time.
