% TODO: Reference the compilers episode of the 50 things podcast for some ideas on how to introduce compilers.

A compiler is an essential ingredient in computer systems. It is responsible for translating the ideas and algorithms written by humans into instructions that machines can act on. In performing the translation, compilers have many different choices in how to generate the instructions. These choices may affect the performance or energy efficiency of a program. Each of the choices was put there by the engineers that built the compiler.

Compilers are frighteningly complex, they are too large to fit inside the mind of a single human, and the number of available choices during compilation is enormous - many more than the number of atoms in the observable universe.

This thesis presents new techniques to simplify compilers and make them easier to build. The main idea is, rather than have compiler builders expertly craft all of the choices, to let compilers learn for themselves.
