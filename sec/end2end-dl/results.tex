%\section{Experimental Results}
%\label{sec:deeptune-results}
%
%This section evaluates the effectiveness of DeepTune for two distinct optimisation tasks: predicting the optimal device to run a given program, and predicting thread coarsening factors.
%
%First, DeepTune is compared against two expert-tuned predictive models, showing that DeepTune outperforms the state-of-the-art in both cases. Section~\ref{subsec:deeptune-transfer-learning} describes leveraging knowledge learned from training DeepTune for one heuristic to boost training for the other heuristic, further improving performance. Finally, Section~\ref{sec:deeptune-internal-states} analyses the working mechanism of DeepTune.
