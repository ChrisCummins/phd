\section{Summary}
\label{sec:deepsmith-conclusion}

We present a novel framework for compiler fuzzing. By posing the generation of
random programs as an unsupervised machine learning problem, we dramatically
reduce the cost and human effort required to engineer a random program
generator. Large parts of the stack are programming language-agnostic, requiring
only a corpus of example programs, an encoder, and a test harness to target a
new language.

We demonstrated our approach by targeting the challenging many-core domain of
OpenCL. Our implementation, DeepSmith, has uncovered dozens of bugs in OpenCL
implementations. We have exposed bugs in parts of the compiler where current
approaches have not, for example in missing error handling. We provided a
preliminary exploration of the extensibility of our approach. Our test cases are
small, two orders of magnitude shorter than the state-of-the-art, and easily
interpretable.
