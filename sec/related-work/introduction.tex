\section{Introduction}

This chapter reviews research in areas relevant to this thesis.

The chapter is divided into two sections, covering the two themes of this thesis. Section~\ref{sec:related-work-generation} reviews the literature of program generation, focusing on compiler testing and benchmarking. Then Section~\ref{sec:related-work-optimisation} reviews the literature of program optimisation, starting with empirical techniques, iterative compilation, and machine learning. Finally Section~\ref{sec:related-work-other} discusses related works that do not fall under either category, and Section~\ref{sec:related-work-summary} concludes.
