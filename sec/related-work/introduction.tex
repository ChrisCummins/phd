\section{Introduction}

This chapter surveys the literature in areas relevant to this thesis. Section~\ref{sec:related-work-generation} reviews research in program generation, focusing first on benchmarking for performance characterisation, then compiler test case generation. Section~\ref{sec:related-work-optimisation} reviews the literature of program optimisation, starting with empirical techniques, iterative compilation, and machine learning. Section~\ref{sec:related-work-other} surveys the literature of relevant works in machine learning for programming languages. Finally Section~\ref{sec:related-work-summary} concludes.
