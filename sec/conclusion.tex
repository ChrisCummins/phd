\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conclusion}

We extend the state-of-the-art in a number of areas. First, we present a generative model for programming languages which [is in some way more capable than prior];
%
our method achieves X-fold increase in production efficiency compared to syntactic generative models (if grammar based approach);
%
and we generate more human-like test-cases for compilers than prior, in (some/most) cases eradicating the need for test-case reduction.
