A benchmark for a Breadth-First Search implementation on GPU. It reads a near regular graph as input and produces the cost (distance from source) of each node in the input graph. 
input sets:
1M  - one million nodes
10M - ten million nodes
NY  - an irregular graph derived from the map of New York. 
SF  - a scale-free graph that's been converted to a near regular graph
