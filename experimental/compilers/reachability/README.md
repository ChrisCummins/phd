# Experiments in Compiler Reachability Analysis

Code structure:

* `datasets/` a set of scripts that produce pandas DataFrames containing CFG
  problem datasets for use with ML tasks, such as reachabilitiy, OpenCL device
  mapping, etc.
* `models/` a set of scripts for training and evaluating ML models on CFG 
  problems.
