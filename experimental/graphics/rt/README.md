![Render](render.jpg)

A fast parallelised ray tracer written in pure C++, with support for
soft lighting, adaptive anti-aliasing, perspective and depth of field.

## Usage

Include the `rt/rt.h` header and link against the compiled
`src/librt.so` library. For example programs, see
`examples/example1.cc` and `examples/example2.cc`.

## Features

* Diffuse (Lambert) and specular (Phong) shading, and recursive
reflections.
* Fast anti-aliasing using adaptive supersampling.
* Camera abstraction providing focal lengths and aperture.
* Automatic scene code generation using
  [mkscene](https://github.com/ChrisCummins/rt/blob/master/scripts/mkscene.py).
