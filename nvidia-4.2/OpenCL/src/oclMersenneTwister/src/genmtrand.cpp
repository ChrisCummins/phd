/*
 * Victor Podlozhnyuk @ 05/13/2007:
 * 1) Fixed sgenrand_mt():
 *    - Fixed loop indexing: 'i' variable was off by one.
 *    - apply wmask right on the state element initialization instead
 *      of separate loop, which could produce machine-dependent results(wrong).
 * 2) Slightly reformatted sources to be included into CUDA SDK.
