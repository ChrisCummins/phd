II.A.   Windows Installation Instructions
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. OpenCL SDK samples included with NVIDIA GPU Computing SDK require a GPU with CUDA Compute 
   Architecture to run properly. For a complete list of CUDA-Architecture compute-enabled GPUs, 
   see the list online at:  http://www.nvidia.com/object/cuda_learn_products.html

2. OpenCL SDK samples in the NVIDIA GPU Computing SDK require version 295.xx or 300.xx of the NVIDIA 
   Display Driver or later to run on 32 bit or 64 bit Windows XP, Windows Vista or Windows 7.  
   This required driver is available pubically through this link.

   http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us
   
   Please make sure to read the Driver Installation Hints Document before you 
   install the driver: http://www.nvidia.com/object/driver_installation_hints.html

       To download the NVIDIA Drivers refer to this link
       
       http://www.nvidia.com/page/pg_20030521269172.html
   
3. This SDK includes OpenCL/DirectX interop SDK samples that depend on the Microsoft DirectX SDK.  
   In order to build these samples, please download the Microsoft DirectX SDK from June 2010 or 
   newer from this link.
       
       http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/directx/default.aspx
   
4. Uninstall any previous versions of the NVIDIA GPU Computing SDK

5. Install the NVIDIA GPU Computing SDK by running the installer provided for your OS.
    
   The default installation folder for the OpenCL SDK is: 

   Windows XP
       C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\NVIDIA Corporation\NVIDIA GPU Computing SDK 4.2\OpenCL

   Windows Vista
       C:\ProgramData\NVIDIA Corporation\NVIDIA GPU Computing SDK 4.2\OpenCL
           
   Note: The "Application Data" and "ProgramData" folders maybe hidden as default in "Windows Explorer"
          on many Windows installations.  They can be made visible in "Windows Explorer" if desired.
          To do this, change the settings in "Folder Options" in the "Tools" menu in the Windows File
		  Explorer.
      
6. After installing the SDK, open the SDK Browser from the Start Menu by clicking on "NVIDIA GPU Computing 
   SDK Browser" in the NVIDIA GPU Computing folder within the NVIDIA Corporation program group 
   installed in the Windows Start Menu.  

      - Each installed SDK sample program is shown along with links for running the executable and 
        viewing the source code files.
 
      - Some of the samples additionally present a link to a Whitepaper describing the sample in detail.
 
      - The samples are presented within the SDK browser in approximate order of complexity, from the least 
        complex projects at the top to the most complex projects at the bottom.

7. Build the 32-bit or 64-bit (match the installation OS), release and debug  
   configurations, of the entire set of SDK projects and utility dependencies using 
   the provided solutions:

      "oclRelease_vs2005.sln" for Visual Studio 2005 (VC8)
	  "oclRelease_vs2008.sln" for Visual Studio 2008 (VC9)
	  "oclRelease_vs2010.sln" for Visual Studio 2010 (VC10)
	  
   These .sln files are installed into the "\NVIDIA GPU Computing SDK 4.2\OpenCL" directory 
   of the SDK. They will build or copy all SDK sample executables (*.exe) and relevant (*.lib) and (*.dll) 
   for the present OS and place execution binaries in the proper directories within   
   "\NVIDIA GPU Computing SDK 4.2\OpenCL\bin\<platform>\<configuration>" 
   
   For subsequent builds, you can either 
      - Use the individual solution files located in each of the examples' directories in 
        "NVIDIA GPU Computing SDK 4.2\OpenCL\src", or
        
      - Use the global solution files located in "\NVIDIA GPU Computing SDK 4.2\OpenCL".
		  "oclRelease_vs2005.sln"
		  "oclRelease_vs2008.sln"
		  "oclRelease_vs2010.sln"
   
8. Build Structure Notes for the OpenCL portion of the NVIDIA GPU Computing SDK:
      
      - "$(PlatformName)" (VS2005/VS2008) or "$(Platform)" (VS2010) is used by the Visual Studio 
	    projects in the SDK to switch to the correct OpenCL.lib file version (Win32 or x64) in the 
		"NVIDIA GPU Computing SDK 4.2\OpenCL\lib" folder.  This is a stublib file needed at build 
		time for implicit linking to the OpenCL dll's, which are installed on the system with the 
		proper NVIDIA GPU driver.
        
      - A post-build event is executed after building:
			  "oclRelease_vs2005.sln",
			  "oclRelease_vs2008.sln",
			  "oclRelease_vs2010.sln"
		and 
			  "oclUtils_vs2005.sln",
			  "oclUtils_vs2008.sln",
			  "oclUtils_vs2010.sln"
				  
		  causing necessary dll's to be copied to the directory within 
		  "NVIDIA GPU Computing SDK 4.2\OpenCL\bin\<platform>\<configuration>" 
		  
        (the same directory containing the *.exe files, as also discussed in item 6 above). This puts 
        the DLL's in the first default path location searched by Windows upon execution. 

      - The samples in the NVIDIA GPU Computing SDK link statically to a utility library called 
        "shrUtils" which is a set of generic C++ utilities unrelated to OpenCL but useful for 
        making sample demonstration applications with any of the NVIDIA GPU Computing API's. 

          - Developers need not worry about shrUtils if step #6 above is executed, because this dependency 
            is taken care of in step #6. But developers may review or edit source code for shrUtils using
			solution files in "\NVIDIA GPU Computing SDK 4.2\shared\":
			
            "shrUtils_vs2005.sln"
			"shrUtils_vs2008.sln"
			"shrUtils_vs2010.sln"
        
          - The release version of SDK samples link to shrUtils[32|64].lib. The debug versions 
            of these samples link to shrUtils[32D|64D].lib .
            
          - The output of the shrUtils_vs2005/08/10.sln compilation is set in project settings to go to the 
            subdirectory "NVIDIA GPU Computing SDK 4.2\shared\lib".
            
          - shrUtils is provided and used in this SDK for convenience only.  It is not necessary for
            independent OpenCL application development.

      - The OpenCL samples in the NVIDIA GPU Computing SDK also link statically to a utility library called 
        "oclUtils" which is a set of OpenCL related or OpenCL SDK specific utilities and also serves as a common 
        header for most standard system includes and shrUtils.
        
          - Developers need not worry about oclUtils if step #6 above is executed, because this dependency 
            is taken care of in step #6.  But developers may review or edit source code for oclUtils using 
            oclUtils is found under "\NVIDIA GPU Computing SDK 4.2\OpenCL\common". 
			
			   "oclUtils_vs2005.sln"
			   "oclUtils_vs2008.sln"
			   "oclUtils_vs2010.sln"

          - The release version of SDK samples link to oclUtils[32|64].lib. The debug versions 
            of these samples link to oclUtils[32D|64D].lib .

          - The output of the oclUtils compilation is set in project settings to go to
            "NVIDIA GPU Computing SDK 4.2\OpenCL\common\lib":

          - oclUtils is provided and used in this SDK for convenience only.  It is not necessary for
            independent OpenCL application development.

9. To view the as-built sample applications after executing step 6, run the examples from the release 
   or debug directories located in: "NVIDIA GPU Computing SDK 4.2\OpenCL\bin\win[32|64]\[release|debug]".

    - All of the SDK applications output messages to a console window that are of interest from the 
      standpoint of understanding basic OpenCL program flow, and several of the applications generate
      graphics output in a separate OpenGL window.  
      
    - Many of the SDK applications present some timing information useful for obtaining an 
      overall perspective of program structure and flow and the time required for setup and 
	  execution of significant functions.  The SDK example code, however, has generally been 
	  simplified for instructional purposes and is not optimized.  Advanced optimization 
	  techniques are beyond the scope of this SDK, and any timing information presented by 
	  the samples is not intended for such usage as benchmarking.  

    - All of the applications additionally log all the console information to a session log file in the
      same directory as the executables.  Those files are named clearly after the name of the sample app, 
      but with a .txt extension.  

    - For convenience, the oclSDK.bat batch file is placed in the executable directory by a 
	  post-build event from built solution files:
	  
			"oclRelease_vs2005.sln"
			"oclRelease_vs2008.sln"
			"oclRelease_vs2010.sln"
	  
	  When running this batch file, execution pauses only briefly at the completion of each sample, 
	  but the log files generated by each application (as noted above) may be viewed at the user's
	  convenience after all samples have completed (a few minutes).  The oclSDK.bat file also creates 
	  the integrated log file "oclSDK.txt" which contains the complete sequence of outputs for all 
	  samples run by oclSDK.bat.

10. A syntax highlighting file for Visual Studio 2005 (VC8), Visual Stuido 2008 (VC9) has been 
    provided with this SDK in "NVIDIA GPU Computing SDK 4.2\OpenCL\doc\usertype.dat".  This file 
	contains OpenCL API data types.  Adding this file to the proper directory (or pasting its 
	contents into any pre-existing copy of this file) prior to starting Visual Studio will 
	provide highlighting of the OpenCL specific data types.  
   
    The default location for the usertype.dat file for VS 8 and VS 9 on 32 bit Windows is
        C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 8\Common7\IDE  or
        C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9\Common7\IDE  

    The default location for the usertype.dat file for VS 8 and VS 9 on 64 bit Windows is
        C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 8\Common7\IDE  or
        C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 9\Common7\IDE     

    See chapter 4 of the NVIDIA OpenCL Getting Started Guide for Windows for more information.

II.B.   Linux Installation Instructions
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. The OpenCL SDK samples in the NVIDIA GPU Computing SDK require a GPU with CUDA Compute 
     Architecture to run properly. For a complete list of CUDA-Architecture compute-enabled GPUs, 
     see the list online at:  http://www.nvidia.com/object/cuda_learn_products.html

2. The OpenCL applications in the NVIDIA GPU Computing SDK require version 258.19 of the NVIDIA 
   Display Driver or later to run on 32 bit or 64 bit Linux.  This required driver is made available to 
   registered developers at: https://nvdeveloper.nvidia.com/login.asp?action=login
   
   Please make sure to read the Driver Installation Hints Document before you 
   install the driver: http://www.nvidia.com/object/driver_installation_hints.html

3. Uninstall any previous versions of the NVIDIA GPU Computing SDK

4. Install the NVIDIA GPU Computing SDK by running the installer provided for your OS.
             
   The default installation folder for the OpenCL SDK is: 

     Linux
           $(HOME)/NVIDIA_GPU_Computing_SDK/  
           
     In the following we will refer to the path that the SDK is installed into as <NV_COMPUTE_SDK_PATH>.    
     
5. Build the 32-bit or 64-bit (match the installation OS), release and debug  
   configurations, of the entire set of SDK projects and utility dependencies.
   a. Go to <NV_COMPUTE_SDK_PATH>/OpenCL
   b. Build:
    - release configuration by typing "make".
    - debug   configuration by typing "make dbg=1".

   Running make at the top level first builds the shared and common utility libraries used by
   the SDK samples (these libraries are simply for convenience and are not part of the OpenCL
   distribution and are not required for your own OpenCL programs). Make then builds each
   of the projects in the SDK.    

6. Run the examples from the release or debug directory located in 
   <NV_COMPUTE_SDK_PATH>/OpenCL/bin/linux/[release|debug].

    - Most of the SDK applications output messages to a console window that are of interest from the 
      standpoint of understanding basic OpenCL program flow, and several of the applications generate
      graphics output in a separate OpenGL window.  
      
    - Many of the SDK applications present some timing information useful for obtaining an 
      overall perspective of program structure and flow and the time required for setup and execution of 
      significant functions.  The SDK example code, however, has generally been simplified for instructional 
      purposes and is not optimized.  Advanced optimization techniques are beyond the scope of this SDK, and 
      any timing information presented by the samples is not intended for such usage as benchmarking.  

    - All of the applications additionally log all the console information to a session log file in the
      same directory as the executables.  Those files are named clearly after the name of the sample app, 
      but with a .txt extension.

    - For convenience, the Makefile in <NV_COMPUTE_SDK_PATH>/OpenCL can be used to execute all 
      SDK samples sequentially by typing "make runall" or "make dbg=1 runall".

III.A.  Creating a new OpenCL Program in Windows using the SDK infrastructure 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Creating a new OpenCL Program using the NVIDIA OpenCL SDK infrastructure is easy.
Just follow these steps:

1. Copy one of the installed OpenCL SDK project folders, in its entirety, into 
   "\NVIDIA GPU Computing SDK 4.2\OpenCL\src" and then rename the folder. Now you have 
   a folder such as "\NVIDIA GPU Computing SDK 4.2\OpenCL\src\<myproject>"

2. Edit the filenames of the project to suit your needs.

3. Edit the *.sln, *.vcproj and source files. Just search and replace all
   occurrences of the old filenames to the new ones you chose.

4. Build the 32-bit and/or 64-bit, release and debug configurations using:
      <myproject>_vs2005.sln
	  <myproject>_vs2008.sln
	  <myproject>_vs2010.sln

5. Run <myproject>.exe from the release or debug, directories located in
   "NVIDIA GPU Computing SDK 4.2\OpenCL\bin\win[32|64]\[release|debug]".

6. Modify the code to perform the computation you require. See the OpenCL
   Programming Guide, the OpenCL API Specifications, and the OpenCL Best Practices Guide
   for details of programming in OpenCL.

   Programming Guide and the OpenCL API Specifications for details of programming in OpenCL.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
IV.A. Creating a new OpenCL Program in Windows outside of the SDK infrastructure
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To create a new OpenCL Program without using the NVIDIA OpenCL SDK infrastructure, a few 
key files are important to find and utilize.

1. The only OpenCL-specific files needed to build an application to run with NVIDIA
   compute-capable GPU's with CUDA architecture on a system with a supported OS using
   recommended NVIDIA Display drivers supporting OpenCL, are:

   - Headers:
        cl.h
        cl_platform.h        
        cl_ext.h
        cl_gl.h
        cl_gl_ext.h
        cl_d3d11_ext.h
        cl_d3d10_ext.h
        cl_d3d9_ext.h
        opencl.h
        
        These files are located in "NVIDIA GPU Computing SDK 4.2\OpenCL\common\inc\CL"

   - Stub Lib
        OpenCL.lib (different file for Win32 and x64 platforms)

        This .lib files are for build-time implicit linking to the OpenCL driver/compiler, 
        OpenCL.dll, and they are located in: 
        
        "NVIDIA GPU Computing SDK 4.2\OpenCL\common\lib\[Win32|x64] 
            
        Note: These lib files are not needed for applications implementing explicit DLL linkage at run-time.

        cl_gl.h
        cl_gl_ext.h
        opencl.h

        These files are located in "NVIDIA GPU Computing SDK 4.2\OpenCL\common\inc\CL"
    
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
V. (a) Known Issues on Mac OSX
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. On Mac OSX SnowLeopard (10.6) the following 3 SDK samples are not included with the OpenCL SDK package.
   These samples are not currently working on OSX SnowLeopard.  We are working to resolve these issues.
 
   -  oclFDTD3D
   -  oclQuasirandomGenerator   
   -  oclSimpleConvolution 
      
2. As of the release date for this updated SDK (OpenCL 1.0 Release), a mismatch with the OpenCL support 
   on Mac OSX may cause build or execution failures.  The SDK and OpenCL binaries supplied with the 
   258.19 drivers are using the very latest headers from Khronos published June 10, 2010, along with 
   updated NVIDIA extension headers.  But symbols for OpenCL support on Mac OSX are provided in
   OpenCL.framework, and the header files for the revision of OpenCL currently supported on Mac OSX are 
   distributed by Apple, Inc. Information about Mac OSX support for OpenCL is available he:
         
http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/Performance/Conceptual/OpenCL_MacProgGuide/Introduction/Introduction.html

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
V. (b) Known Issues on Linux
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	1. The SDK samples that make use of OpenGL fail to build or link.  This is because many of the default
       installations for many Linux distributions do not include the necessary OpenGL, GLUT, GLU, GLEW, 
	   X11, Xi, Xlib, or Xmi headers or libraries.  Here are some general and specific solutions:

       (a) Redhat 4 Linux Distributions
	       "ld: cannot find -lglut".  On some linux installations, building the oclSimpleGL example 
		   show the following linking error like the following.

			/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lglut

	        Typically this is because the SDK makefiles look for libglut.so and not for
	        variants of it (like libglut.so.3). To confirm this is the problem, simply 
	        run the following command.

			ls /usr/lib | grep glut

			ls /usr/lib64 | grep glut

	        You should see the following (or similar) output.

		    lrwxrwxrwx  1 root root     16 Jan  9 14:06 libglut.so.3 -> libglut.so.3.8.0
		    -rwxr-xr-x  1 root root 164584 Aug 14  2004 libglut.so.3.8.0

	        If you have libglut.so.3 in /usr/lib and/or /usr/lib64, simply run the following command 
	        as root.

			ln -s /usr/lib/libglut.so.3 /usr/lib/libglut.so
			ln -s /usr/lib64/libglut.so.3 /usr/lib64/libglut.so

	        If you do NOT have libglut.so.3 then you can check whether the glut package
	        is installed on your RHEL system with the following command.

			rpm -qa | grep glut

	        You should see "freeglut-2.2.2-14" or similar in the output.  If not, you 
	        or your system administrator should install the package "freeglut-2.2.2-14".
	        Refer to the Red Hat and/or rpm documentation for instructions.

	        If you have libglut.so.3 but you do not have write access to /usr/lib, you 
	        can also fix the problem by creating the soft link in a directory to which 
	        you have write permissions and then add that directory to the library 
	        search path (-L) in the Makefile.
        
		(b) Some Linux distributions (i.e. Redhat or Fedora) do not include the GLU library.  
		    You can find the latest packages download this file from this website.  Please 
			make sure you match the correct Linux distribution.

	         http://fr.rpmfind.net/linux/rpm2html/search.php?query=libGLU.so.1&submit=Search+...

        (c) (SLED11) SUSE Linux Enterprise Edition 11 is missing:
	        "libGLU", "libX11" "libXi", "libXm" 

	        This particular version of SUSE Linux 11 does not have the proper symbolic links for the following libraries:

	        i.   libGLU
			
			     ls /usr/lib | grep GLU
		         ls /usr/lib64 | grep GLU

		         libGLU.so.1
		         libGLU.so.1.3.0370300

		         To create the proper symbolic links (32-bit and 64-bit OS)
		       
			     ln -s /usr/lib/libGLU.so.1 /usr/lib/libGLU.so  
		         ln -s /usr/lib64/libGLU.so.1 /usr/lib64/libGLU.so  

	        ii.  libX11
			
		         ls /usr/lib | grep X11

	    (d) Ubuntu Linux unable to build these SDK samples that use OpenGL

	        The default Ubuntu distribution is missing many libraries
	   
	        i.  What is missing are the GLUT, Xi, Xmu, GL, and X11 headers.  To add these headers and 
			    libraries to your distribution, type the following in at the command line.
 
	            sudo apt-get install freeglut3-dev build-essential libx11-dev libxmu-dev libxi-dev libgl1-mesa-glx libglu1-mesa libglu1-mesa-dev 
	   
            ii. Note, by installing Mesa, you may see linking errors against libGL.  This can be solved below:
	   
            cd /usr/lib/
            sudo rm libGL.so 
            sudo ln -s libGL.so.1 libGL.so

VII.  Change Log (most recent changes listed first)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OpenCL R295 and R300 updated
* Driver support for Kepler GPU architectures.

OpenCL R285 RC1 Update
* Added oclMultiThreads - OpenCL SDK sample that demonstrates how to use the new events and callback functions.
  Note, that by default the oclRelease_vs2005.sln does not include the solution file for oclMultiThreads.
  In order to build this sampke with VS2005, you must install the Microsoft SDK v6.0 or newer.  VS2008 and VS2010
  projects are included with this sample.

OpenCL R280 Update
* Adds support for OpenCL 1.1

OpenCL R270 Update
* Added VS2010 project support for OpenCL SDK samples, SDK samples will now build with Visual Studio 2010
* Added SDK sample: oclInlinePTX - demonstrates how to embed PTX within OpenCL kernels
* Updated OpenCL individual SDK sample solution files (*.sln) for VS2005, VS2008, and VS2010.  
  Now the individual solutions include project dependencies with SDK helper libraries.  If a SDK sample
  depend on linking with shrUtils or oclUtils, the individual OpenCL SDK samples can now be built 
  without using oclRelease_vs20??.sln to build its dependencies.

OpenCL R260 Release
* Added SDK sample: oclMarchingCubes

OpenCL R260 Beta Release Candidate
* Added SDK sample: oclTridiagonal

OpenCL 1.0 Release
* Added SDK samples: oclSimpleD3D9Texture, oclSimpleD3D10Texture
* Removed work-around in oclCopyComputeOverlap due to fixes in 258.19 driver
* Miscellaneous cleanups, bug fixes and improvements

OpenCL R256 Beta
* Added SDK samples: oclHiddenMarkovModel, oclSimpleD3D9Texture, and oclSimpleD3D10Texture
* Minor cleanups and improvements

OpenCL R195 Release
* All OpenCL headers from Khronos updated
* NVIDIA OpenCL extension headers updated and 4 new ones added
	(cl_gl_ext.h, cl_d3d11_ext.h, cl_d3d10_ext.h, cl_d3d9_ext.h)
* Support for ICD, CL-GL interop and CL-D3D interop
	http://www.khronos.org/registry/cl/
* Some SDK samples using both OpenGL and OpenCL have been updated to use new CL-GL interop
* Added oclCopyComputeOverlap
  - Demonstrates how to handle copy and kernel execution with OpenCL
* Bug fixes and improvements
* Updated documentation

OpenCL R195 Update Release
* Miscellaneous SDK source code refinements in conjunction with updated/improved drivers
* Included Khronos OpenCL Specification and quick reference card updated to latest versions
* clext.h file name changed to cl_ext.h
* Enumeration names for extensions in cl_ext.h have been updated
* OpenCL.lib updated for change in OpenCL.dll (distributed separately with driver) from __cdecl to __stdcall   
* Previous NVIDIA OpenCL drivers permitted developers to assume that the NULL or default platform, 
  as passed to clCreateContext and related calls, was NVIDIA's platform. This approach is incompatible 
  with supporting multiple vendors on a single platform (it would be unclear which vendor is the default). 
  To prepare for compatibility with future multi-vendor OpenCL installations, NVIDIA’s drivers will no longer 
  honor NULL as a platform. This requires OpenCL programs to be changed explicitly enumerate the 
  available platforms and choose the appropriate vendors.  This change is reflected in the sample code
  in this SDK release.

OpenCL R190 Update Release
* OpenCL compiler/driver moved from SDK to r190 GPU driver
