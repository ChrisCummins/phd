We thank the reviewers for the positive feedback and their time in evaluating
our artifact.

# Review 1

1.1. We have updated the GitHub repository with further information describing
     our installation scripts. Please see: https://goo.gl/RVdDVf

1.2. We will look into the discrepancy you observed between Rodinia in Fig 6a
     and the artifact. Thanks for pointing this out.

# Review 2

2.1. We wrote our scripts for Ubuntu as this is what we use, however we
     acknowledge that not everyone uses it. We have updated our build scripts to
     support CentOS, Ubuntu, and Arch Linux. Please see: https://goo.gl/sS8LVv

2.2. Sorry to hear about your problems running Case Study B. The ML backend
     uses OpenBLAS when compiled for CPU. We suspect the problems arises from
     there, but this dependency is buried deep in the TensorFlow stack. If you
     would like, send me an email at chrisc.101@gmail.com with the details of
     your system and I can try to replicate the problem.

2.3. We use author-provided data sets for benchmark runtimes. For Case Study A,
     new benchmark runtimes may be collected on other architectures using the
     artifact from the publication: https://goo.gl/ZT8ZHH
