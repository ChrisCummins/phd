// Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at
// index i of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original
// array except the one at i.
//
// For example, if our input was [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the expected output would be
// [120, 60, 40, 30, 24]. If our input was [3, 2, 1], the expected output would
// be [2, 3, 6].
//
// Follow-up: what if you can't use division?
