// This problem was asked by Facebook.
//
// A builder is looking to build a row of N houses that can be of K different
// colors. He has a goal of minimizing cost while ensuring that no two
// neighboring houses are of the same color.
//
// Given an N by K matrix where the nth row and kth column represents the cost
// to build the nth house with kth color, return the minimum cost which achieves
// this goal.

int main(int argc, char** argv) { return 0; }
