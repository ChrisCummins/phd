// This problem was asked by Google.
//
// You are given an M by N matrix consisting of booleans that represents a
// board. Each True boolean represents a wall. Each False boolean represents a
// tile you can walk on.
//
// Given this matrix, a start coordinate, and an end coordinate, return the
// minimum number of steps required to reach the end coordinate from the start.
// If there is no possible path, then return null. You can move up, left, down,
// and right. You cannot move through walls. You cannot wrap around the edges of
// the board.
//
// For example, given the following board:
//
// [[f, f, f, f],
// [t, t, f, t],
// [f, f, f, f],
// [f, f, f, f]]
//
// and start = (3, 0) (bottom left) and end = (0, 0) (top left), the minimum
// number of steps required to reach the end is 7, since we would need to go
// through (1, 2) because there is a wall everywhere else on the second row.

int main(int argc, char** argv) { return 0; }
