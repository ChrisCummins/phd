// Given the mapping a = 1, b = 2, ... z = 26, and an encoded message, count the
// number of ways it can be decoded.

// For example, the message '111' would give 3, since it could be decoded as
// 'aaa', 'ka', and 'ak'.
//
// You can assume that the messages are decodable. For example, '001' is not
// allowed.
