// This problem was asked by Google.
//
// Given two singly linked lists that intersect at some point, find the
// intersecting node. The lists are non-cyclical.
//
// For example, given A = 3 -> 7 -> 8 -> 10 and B = 99 -> 1 -> 8 -> 10, return
// the node with value 8.
//
// In this example, assume nodes with the same value are the exact same node
// objects.
//
// Do this in O(M + N) time (where M and N are the lengths of the lists) and
// constant space.

int main(int argc, char** argv) { return 0; }
