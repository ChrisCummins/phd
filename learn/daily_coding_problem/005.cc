// An XOR linked list is a more memory efficient doubly linked list. Instead of
// each node holding next and prev fields, it holds a field named both, which is
// an XOR of the next node and the previous node. Implement an XOR linked list;
// it has an add(element) which adds the element to the end, and a get(index)
// which returns the node at index.
//
// If using a language that has no pointers (such as Python), you can assume you
// have access to get_pointer and dereference_pointer functions that converts
// between nodes and memory addresses.
