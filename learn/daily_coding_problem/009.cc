// This problem was asked by Amazon.
//
// There exists a staircase with N steps, and you can climb up either 1 or 2
// steps at a time. Given N, write a function that returns the number of unique
// ways you can climb the staircase. The order of the steps matters.
//
// For example, if N is 4, then there are 5 unique ways:
//
// 1, 1, 1, 1
// 2, 1, 1
// 1, 2, 1
// 1, 1, 2
// 2, 2
// What if, instead of being able to climb 1 or 2 steps at a time, you could
// climb any number from a set of positive integers X? For example, if X = {1,
// 3, 5}, you could climb 1, 3, or 5 steps at a time.

int main(int argc, char** argv) { return 0; }
