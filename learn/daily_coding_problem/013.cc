// This problem was asked by Twitter.
//
// You run an e-commerce website and want to record the last N order ids in a
// log. Implement a data structure to accomplish this, with the following API:
//
// record(order_id): adds the order_id to the log
// get_last(i): gets the ith last element from the log. i is guaranteed to be
// smaller than or equal to N.
// You should be as efficient with time and space as possible.

int main(int argc, char** argv) { return 0; }
