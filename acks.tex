I am indebted to Hugh Leather and Pavlos Petoumenos, who have made my four years as a PhD candidate a deeply gratifying trajectory of learning, curiosity, and occasional hard work. Thank you.

I would like also to thank Zheng Wang, with whom I have collaborated on projects which form parts of this thesis. Thank you to Michel Steuwer for providing unapologetically thorough feedback on select chapters of this thesis, improving them measurably.

I would like to thank my friends and colleagues at the University of Edinburgh, Google, DeepMind, and Codeplay Software whose company I have had the pleasure of keeping. Finally, I would like to thank Ashleigh, she makes everything possible.

Hello to Jason Isaacs.
